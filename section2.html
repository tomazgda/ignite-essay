        <h3>Software History</h3>

  <h4>Introduce: Windows</h4>

  <p>The stories goes, it was late 1974 when Paul Allen first became aware of the Altair 8800 - a microcomputer designed by MITS. According to wikipedia, he was walking through harvard square when he saw the cover of the January 1975 issue of Polpular Electronics, displaying the personal computer. Sparked by intruige, he went over to Currier House at Harvard Collegue to show the magazune to his high school friend Bill Gates - studying at Harvard at the time.</p>

  <p>The Altair's appeal came to both Gates and Allen as it was one of the first affordable personal computers. In other words, it was sure to create large swathes of demand in the consumer electronics market. The two decided to write the first programming language for the machine, an interpreter for BASIC, which they developed in the span of eight weeks. After completion, Allen took a flight to Albequrque to demo their software to MITS. The demonstration was a success and MITS agreed to ditrobute what was named Altair BASIC. From there, Gates left harvard to found Microsoft (microcompute software) with Allen and so it began.</p>

  <p>Microsofts first hardware product was the Z-80 SoftCard - a device that enabled the Apple 2 to run the CP/M operating system. CP/M was a industry standard, mainstream operating system. One of the first, in fact; it was released in 1974. At the stage they were in then, the Z-80 was incredibly succesful, selling roughly 5000 units at $349 each. Microsoft then continued to release their first operating stystem: a variant of Unix, dubbed Xenix. Xenix was used as a platform by Microsoft to develop some of their first user applications, Word amongst them.</p>

 <p>Back when IBM made personal computers, they were planning on contracting microsoft to develop another BASIC interpreter for the IMB PC. They originally intended on licensing CP/M though they could not secure a deal with Digital Research who owned it. So they sought a new operating system. Microsoft was asked to develop a OS similar to CP/M, which they of course accepted, and MS-DOS was born.</p>

 <p>MS-DOS was really a renamed form of 86-DOS, developed by Seattle Computer Products. It had no graphical user interface (GUI) however, with the release of Windows 1.0 in 1985, one was added. The concept of Windows was that the user could open multiple graphical windows simultaniously, hence the name. MS-DOS continued to serve as the primary Windows Kernal unitl the reale of Windows NT 3.1 which used the Windows NT kernal.</p>

 <p>As it grew, Microsofts stategy for Windows became apparent: build software for developers and accumulate compatibility. Windows was built to serve the developer; it was desgined, from the begining, to be the standard OS - the defacto, go-to system. Microsoft knew that if they could secure a large enough market share ealy on, they would be able to secure a stable monopoly for decades. Why? Because operating systems rely on compatibility so they require software manufatures deciding to implement native support. This is why, even today, though Windows is not as intuitive or aestetically pleasing to the user as its competitors, it remains the prodominent OS because of its support from developers.</p>

 <p>Later on, I will argue that this advantage of combality is drying out as it has become far more convinient for developers to introduce native support across multiple platforms: MacOS, GNU/Linux, Windows, etc. The tools which developers use to create have implemented functionalities that allow for multi-platform distrobution with ease. If a game studio using unreal engine, for example, wishes to publish their game for linux and windows, they can - without much extra effot. This new convience turns the table as it is becoming worwhile to the developer to focus on platforms that aren't Windows.</p>

<h4>A Step Back: UNIX</h4>

<p>In the late 60s, Bell Labs, MIT and the General Electric Company partnered to develop a time-sharing sytem dubbed Multics - Multoplex Information and Computing Service. The project was meant to allow multiple users to access a mainframe simultaniously. Mainframes - centralised comupters that distrobuted processing power to a number of clients - were the first to adobt the operating system 'Unix' which was created later on.</p>

<p>After the increasing frustration of Bell Labs management towards Multics, they pulled out of the project. However, they immediatley began work on their own operating system, intended for the same purposes as Multics but without what they deemed unessesary size and complexity. The first version of this new OS (UNIX) was written in the PDP-7 assembler language - a low level language close to machine code. Though further modifications, the Bell Labs team switched to the high-level language 'B' before ultimatley creating the now very common language 'C'. Unix components were eventually rewritten in C, the last of which - the kernal - written in 1973.</p>

<p>Unix was distrobuted primarily to large organisations to run on their mainframes; in its early stages, it was rare to use it for a smaller-scale system. In 1974, the University of California at Berkley recieved a copy of the system resulting in them adapting UNIX and forming their own operating system: BSD (Berkeley Software System). BSD is thought to have transpired into many later systems, including DarwinOS, the foundation of Mac OS X.</p>
