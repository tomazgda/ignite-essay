        <h3>Why Include This Section?</h3>

        <p>I deemed it necessery to desginate a page of this essay soley to explaining why the use of Wikipedia is so frequent throughout my research becasuse of the schools unjust atitude towards wikipedia. Although I understand why the school does this, the reason why is one that lacks sense to me and I believe it imature to instill anti-wiki behaviour into pupils.</p>

        <p>I raised this concern before and arranged a meet to discuss the matter but I was met with less of a back-and-forth and more of a monologue by a member of the faculty. At the time, I wayed up the risks assosiated with continuing the argument and eventually decided to abandon the endevour. However, in this instance, I believe I should write up an argument as to not recieve negative feedback from the school regarding the use of wikipedia.</p>

        <h3>Why Use Wikepedia?</h3>

        <p>One would use the wikipedia for the same reason as any other website; the point of the internet is that you're capable of accesing multiple sites. No one should restrict themselves only one website and one should feel comfortable viewing information from any site as long as it is correctly sited - which Wikipedia is.</p>



        <h3>Reliablity</h3>

        <p>It is easy to argue that allowing anyone to contribute to a source of information would produce inaccurate information. However, this argument is fundamentally flawed in the sense that it is Wikepedia's user base that make it so accurate. Once more, Wikipedia bears millions of articles sometimes conainting information unreadily available elsewhere. Whilst it is hard to find concrete studies on the reliablity of Wikipedia, those out there suggest incredible results. Below is just a handfull of articles relvelent to Wikipedia's reliabitly.</p>

        <h3>Why The School Discourages Wikepedia</h3>

        <p>I assume the schools atitude towards wikepedia evolved from a desire for liablity. That is if a student, pehaps higher up in the school, was to write a essay using information gathered from wikepedia or indeed any other editable site and part of that information happened to be wrong, there would be no one to blame. I stress the word evolved here as we have been specifically told, at our level of the school, not to use wikepedia - a complete over reaction to a negligable issue in secondary education.</p>
