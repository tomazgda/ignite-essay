        <h3>Literature Review</h3>

      <p>This essay focusses more on discussion that an objective true of fasle statem+ent. It is not structured in the conventional manour for ignite which, I imagine, is observing the cause and effect of "x" on "y" with some other parameteres that create a more niche topic. I differed slighly from the norm, the title not being a description of the essay but rather a face for it. To write a literature review, as we have been tought, one needs a hypothesis that they are attempting to prove correct. The literature review serves to package information provided by others that assists in justifying the hypothesis. I could find no aspect of this essay which required such indeph anaysis of a source to prove its reliablity or the need in the first place for a source rather than to merely gather knowledge.</p>

      <p>This essay is intended to raise ethical concerns about our usage of certain forms of software. I have shared my opinion on the matter - an opinion derived from the opions of others - and that is all. At what point is it necessery for me to construct what we percieve as a normal literature review when I have no specific sources.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, instead of analyising sources that are the output of anybody's work, I thought I would, for this literature review, review the people themselves. After all, most of what we know is a regurgitation of other's knowledge. Here are some of the people whos knowledge I interpreted in the makings of this essay:</p>

      <h3>Richard Stallman</h3>

      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Richard_Stallman_at_LibrePlanet_2019.jpg/1024px-Richard_Stallman_at_LibrePlanet_2019.jpg" alt="Richard Stallman" style="float:right;width:50%;height:;">

      <h4>Character</h4>

      <p>Richard Stallman is a programmer - quite an astonashing one aswell. But, beyond that, he is a political activist; he is a campaigner of human rights with regards to software - a field not typically considered when reflecting upon our liberties. He is the architect of the GNU project and a front runner in the free software movement. Stallman argues for a world without the proprietary software that lets coorparations puppet us with malicious programs that strip control away from the user.</p>

      <p>The free software movement, and subsidiaries of, has been covered already but the crucial takeaway here is that Richard Stallman was behind it; those that continue to fight the companies we mindlessly sell our souls to are doing so because of him. Fame frequently corrupts those that aquire it but if anyone is impervious to any form of corruption, or even moral ambiguity, it's Richard Stallman.</p>

      <h4>Mediums</h4>

      <p>This section will follow more strictly along the lines of a literature review, foccusing on specific sources rather. The first of which being the GNU website, primarily, in this instance, the GNU manifesto which can be found here:</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">GNU Manifesto</a></p>

      <p>Written in 1985, the GNU manifesto was rather similar to most other manifestos: it detailed what the main concept was, offered answers for common queries and sought help to further its development. For anyone unsure of what the GNU project is, it is a great source, though quite old, to seek answers about GNU.</p>

      <p><a href="https://stallman.org/">Stallman's Personal Site</a></p>

      There is no doubt that Stallman can appear quite eccentric at times. Even he would likely not suggest that everyone must live the life he does though it is definately benefitial to take a look at his perception of the world.

      <p><a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/20140407-geneva-tedx-talk-free-software-free-society">Ted Talk</a></p>

      Lectures (or talks) serve as a convinient medium for gathering information. Ted talks are some of the best if all you desire is a brief introduction to a topic and that holds true to Stallmans talk. Above is the link to the talk hosted on the Free Software Movement's website where the video complies with the principles of free software - you can download it. Downloading a video is an operation so mundane that it is often overlooked but it is common practice to block video downloading. Youtube, for example, prohibits its users from downloading videos unless they pay a premium and, even then, they can only view the downloaded content on Youtube.

      <h3>Linus Torvalds</h3>

      <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.facesofopensource.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F02%2F09202215%2Flinus.faces22052.web_.jpg&f=1&nofb=1" alt="Linus Torvalds" style="float:right;width:50%;height:;">

      <h4>Character</h4>

      <p>Linus Torvalds is most famously known for developing the Linux kernal as well as Git. The linux kernal is present in most of the worlds computers. From desktops to smartphones to fridges, Linux is everywhere. It serves as the kernal for most GNU/Linux operating systems aswell as the world's largest mobile OS: Android.</p>

      <p>Linus originally began writing the kernal as he was displeased by the costs assosiated with pre-existing UNIX and MS-DOS systems. After completion of the kenral, those at the GNU project, who needed a kernal to complete their operating system, decided to use it and so GNU/Linux was born.</p>

      <h4>Mediums</h4>

      <p><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux">Ted Talk</a></p>

      <p>As with before, Ted talks are possibly one of the best ways to learn of certain topics.</p>

      <!-- WRITE MORE HERE -->

      <p><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux">Wikipedia: Linus Torvalds</a></p>

      <p><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux">Wikipedia: Linuk Kernal</a></p>

      <p>Unlike Stallman, Linus doesn't have a personal website. He also doesn't tend to write as many online articles aswell. However, a key source to learn more about not only Linus, but also the Linux kernal itself is the wikipedia article respective to either.
