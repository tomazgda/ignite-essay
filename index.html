      <h1>Ignite Essay</h1>

      <h3>Brief</h3>
      <p class="w3-text-32">Upon reflection of my previous essay, I decided to write anew. I admit, it was less an 'Ignite' essay and more an outcome of my bordem one weekend - amalgamating into a sort of manifesto. Returning to the point, my next obstacle was to imagine what the contents of this new, perhaps slightly rushed, would be. </p>

      <p>
      I recalled my frustration over the unit regarding the use of Microsoft's proprietary software - applications that were drilled into our souls every waking minute. Whilst quite melodramatic, the inablity to use desired tools was tormenting. That brought me to the question: why is it that some of the greatest programs aren't accepted by the norm? Furthermore, why is it that some are seemingly incapable to operate on any platform other than Windows's basic software. I would like to stress 'basic' here - these applications are severly limmited in funtion, only used efficeintly for the most primative tasks.

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p class="w3-text-32">This essay will be structured to cover the following topics:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>How do computers actually work?</li>
        <li>How did Windows become so large?</li>
        <li>Why are some platforms better than others?</li>
        <li>Prospects for the future.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My objective in writing this is, hopefully, to spread competence. To free those trapped within an ecosystem of inefficiency and difficulty. It is outrages that a single company has monopolised productivity. These are tools that we begin to teach to children from primary school; many, by the time they leave school, have still not sought alternatives. Change begins in education and education must change.</p>

<h3>How Do Computers Actually Work?</h3>

    <p>Gosh. This question is quite extensive - probably to the point that I shouldn't delve into it. To produce a factual and decenlty complex answer with the limmited expertise that I have would be challenging at the least. Altough, I wouldn't dare turn away a challenge.

    <p>To begin with the fundementals, computers store information using binary, representing everything with zeros and ones. For example, numbers (in denary) can be represented with binary; the number 1 would be stored as 0. The number 2 would be stored as 10. This sytem works by each '1' (binary) representing a number (a multiple of two), that increases in size dependant on how many digits proceed it. E.g '1000' (binary) is comprised of a one followed by three digits. This would mean that the '1' represents '8' (denary) so '1000' (binary) is equal to '8' (denary). Each additional digit that proceeds multiplies the value of the '1' by two. Another example would be that '10' (binary) is equal to '2' (denary)  because the '1' is proceeded by one digit, giving it the value '2' and the '0' has no value. Adding these two values (2 and 0) together, leaves you with the value '2'.</p>

    <p>In a computer, using zeros and ones is incredibly useful as they can be represented by the flow of an electric current or the lack there of. This allows computers to have memory. They can use these memory for tasks, taking an input, running it through an operation, and delivering an output - this is the job of the CPU. The CPU (central processing unit), draws parralles with the human brain: it is the centre of operations for a computer. At the most basic level, the CPU is essentailly a collection of transitors. Transiors are devices used to manipulate electric current by switching the path of the current. That's it! The heart of all operations of every computer is a bunch of switches.</p>

    <p>Tasks are performed using logic gates. Logic gates, of course, are composed of transitors. They perform simple, logic tasks. For instance, an 'AND' gate takes two one-digit binary values and displays a one-digit result. This result is always '0' unless the two inputs are both '1' where it will output '1'. There are other kinds of logic gates and, though combinations of different gates, they can create useful operations.  <p/>

alt="Half_Adder" width="30%" height="" style="float:right">

<p>Displayed is an example of one of these operations. This is a half-adder; a combinations of two logic gates (AND and XOR) that take two one-digit inputs and outputs a 'sum'and a 'carry', both one-digit. The function of the half-adder is, as the name may suggest, to add two numbers. Take the numbers '1' and '0' (denary). This would output 'sum' = '1', which translates to the value '1', which is correct. Understanding the adder bears no complications expect when adding the digits '1' and '1' where 'sum' displays '0' and 'count' displays '1'. Refering back to the defintion of binary storage, count imagines a number with an extra digit proceeding it. In this case a count of '1' would have the value '2'.</p>
