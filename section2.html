        <h3>How Did Windows Become So Large?</h3>

  <p>The stories goes, it was late 1974 when Paul Allen first became aware of the Altair 8800 - a microcomputer designed by MITS. According to wikipedia, he was walking through harvard square when he saw the cover of the January 1975 issue of Polpular Electronics, displaying the personal computer. Sparked by intruige, he went over to Currier House at Harvard Collegue to show the magazune to his high school friend Bill Gates - studying at Harvard at the time.</p>

  <p>The Altair's appeal came to both Gates and Allen as it was one of the first affordable personal computers. In other words, it was sure to create large swathes of demand in the consumer electronics market. The two decided to write the first programming language for the machine, an interpreter for BASIC, which they developed in the span of eight weeks. After completion, Allen took a flight to Albequrque to demo their software to MITS. The demonstration was a success and MITS agreed to ditrobute what was named Altair BASIC. From there, Gates left harvard to found Microsoft (microcompute software) with Allen and so it began. </p>

  <p>Back when IBM made personal computers, they were planning on contracting microsoft to develop another BASIC interpreter for the IMB PC. They originally intended on licensing the CP/M operating system though they could not secure a deal with Digital Research who owned it. So they sought a new operating syste. Microsoft was asked to develop a OS similar to CP/M, which they of course accepted, and MS-DOS was born.</p>

 <p>MS-DOS was really a renamed form of 86-DOS, developed by Seattle Computer Products. It had no graphical user interface (GUI) however, with the release of Windows 1.0 in 1985, one was added. The concept of Windows was that the user could open multiple graphical windows simultaniously, hence the name. MS-DOS continued to serve as the primary Windows Kernal unitl the reale of Windows NT 3.1 which used the Windows NT kernal.</p>

 <p>As it grew, Microsofts stategy for Windows became apparent: built software for developers and accumulate compatibility. Windows was built to serve the developer; it was desgined, from the begining, to be the standard OS - the defacto, go-to system. Microsoft knew that if they could secure a large enough market share ealy on, they would be able to secure a stable monopoly for decades. Why? Because operating systems rely on compatibility so they require software manufature deciding to implement native support. This is why, even today, though Windows is not as intuitive or aestetically pleasing to the user as its competitors, it remains the prodominent OS because of its support from developers.</p>

 <p>Later on, I will argue that this advantage of combality is drying out as it has become far more convinient for developers to introduce native support across multiple platforms: macos, linux, windows, etc. The tools which developers use to create have implemented functionalities that allow for multi-platform distrobution with ease. If a game studio using unreal engine, for example, wishes to publish their game for linux and windows, they can - without much extra effot. This new convience turns the table as it is becoming worwhile to the developer to focus on platforms that aren't Windows. An elaboration on this will follow in part 3 but, for now, I will continue with the history of Windows.</p>
