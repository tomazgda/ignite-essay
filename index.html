      <h1>Ignite Essay</h1>

      <h3>Brief</h3>

      <p>First of all, the source code for this website is available through the link below.</p>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/tomazgda/ignite-essay.git">Source On GitHub</a></p>

      <p class="w3-text-32">Upon reflection of my previous essay, I decided to write anew. I admit, it was less an 'Ignite' essay and more an outcome of my boredom one weekend - amalgamating into a sort of manifesto. Returning to the point, my next obstacle was to imagine what the contents of this new, perhaps slightly rushed, would be. </p>

      <p>
      I recalled my frustration over the unit regarding the use of Microsoft's proprietary software - applications that were drilled into our souls every waking minute. Whilst quite melodramatic, the inability to use desired tools was tormenting. That brought me to the question: why is it that some of the greatest programs aren't accepted by the norm? Furthermore, why is it that some are seemingly incapable to operate on any platform other than Windows's basic software. I would like to stress 'basic' here - these applications are severely limited in function, only used efficiently for the most primitive tasks.
      </p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p class="w3-text-32">This essay will be structured to cover the following topics:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>How do computers actually work?</li>
        <li>Software History</li>
        <li>GNU/Linux</li>
        <li>Proprietary; Open Source; Free Software</li>
        <li>Close to home applications</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My objective in writing this is, hopefully, to spread competence. To free those trapped within an ecosystem of inefficiency and difficulty. It is outrages that a single company has monopolised productivity. These are tools that we begin to teach to children from primary school; many, by the time they leave school, have still not sought alternatives. Change begins in education and education must change.</p>

<h3>How Do Computers Actually Work?</h3>

    <p>This question is quite extensive - probably to the point that I shouldn't delve into it. To produce a factual and decently complex answer with the limited expertise that I have would be challenging at the least. Although, I wouldn't dare turn away a challenge.</p>

<h4>Binary</h4>

    <p>To begin with the fundamentals, computers store information using binary, representing everything with zeros and ones. For example, numbers (in denary) can be represented with binary; the number 1 would be stored as 0. The number 2 would be stored as 10. This system works by each '1' (binary) representing a number (a multiple of two), that increases in size dependant on how many digits proceed it. E.g '1000' (binary) is comprised of a one followed by three digits. This would mean that the '1' represents '8' (denary) so '1000' (binary) is equal to '8' (denary). Each additional digit that proceeds multiplies the value of the '1' by two. Another example would be that '10' (binary) is equal to '2' (denary)  because the '1' is proceeded by one digit, giving it the value '2' and the '0' has no value. Adding these two values (2 and 0) together, leaves you with the value '2'.</p>

    <p>In a computer, using zeros and ones is incredibly useful as they can be represented by the flow of an electric current or the lack there of. This allows computers to have memory. They can use these memory for tasks, taking an input, running it through an operation, and delivering an output - this is the job of the CPU. The CPU (central processing unit), draws parallels with the human brain: it is the centre of operations for a computer. At the most basic level, the CPU is essentially a collection of transistors. Transistors are devices used to manipulate electric current by switching the path of the current. That's it! The heart of all operations of every computer is a bunch of switches.</p>

<h4>Logic</h4>

    <p>Tasks are performed using logic gates. Logic gates, of course, are composed of transistors. They perform simple, logic tasks. For instance, an 'AND' gate takes two one-digit binary values and displays a one-digit result. This result is always '0' unless the two inputs are both '1' where it will output '1'. There are other kinds of logic gates and, though combinations of different gates, they can create useful operations.  <p/>

<img src=
"https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2Fd%2Fd9%2FHalf_Adder.svg%2F1920px-Half_Adder.svg.png&f=1&nofb=1"
alt="Half_Adder" width="30%" height="" style="float:right">

<p>Displayed is an example of one of these operations. This is kind of circuit, in this case a half-adder; a combinations of two logic gates (AND and XOR) that take two one-digit inputs and outputs a 'sum' and a 'carry', both one-digit. The function of the half-adder is, as the name may suggest, to add two numbers. Take the numbers '1' and '0' (denary). This would output 'sum' = '1', which translates to the value '1', which is correct. Understanding the adder bears no complications expect when adding the digits '1' and '1' where 'sum' displays '0' and 'count' displays '1'. Referring back to the definition of binary storage, count imagines a number with an extra digit proceeding it. In this case a count of '1' would have the value '2'. This is correct; 1 add 1 does equal 2.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine how processes as simple as these can scale up, forming the computers we now have in our homes. But somehow, through whatever means, we as a species have managed to create what is, to me, the display piece of humanity.<p/>

<p>Scaling is actually where this get interesting. Relatively simple circuits, such as the adder, can be combined, yet again, to complete more complex operations - e.g multiplication. However, at this stage, it is necessary to store quickly accessible short-term information, as to not have to fetch data from the computer's slower, permanent storage. This memory can be stored using logic gates in what are called 'flip-flops'. Flip-flops are key when running programs as it allows the function to store critical information and refer back to that information some time later to complete more complex operations. Quite a mouthful but it's essentially similar to jotting down notes when attempting a maths question or, for that matter, solving any problem.</p>

<p>Escalating many levels above, programs are a list of instructions given to a computer which it will then process, as discussed, before producing an output. These programs are written, most of the time, by a person through a programming language. Programming languages are used to interface with a computer's hardware. The programming languages that we use to write programs are known as high-level languages. This simply means that they are easier to use as certain operations are abbreviated. The most low-level programming languages are ones that interface almost directly (or directly) to the computer's hardware. These are not recommended to be used for common programs.</p>

<h4>Software</h4>

<p>Now, one may ask how any of this information relates with operating systems and applications. It does as an operating system is a set of programs that allow applications to interface with the computer's hardware. Applications are programs installed on top of an operating system that provide additional functionality.</p>

<p>At the core of an operating system there is what's called a kernel, almost definitely named after a corn kernel. Whilst it would be possible to elaborate on kernels for the entire essay, I will keep the definition brief. A kernel serves to connect a computer's hardware together and allow for applications to interface with the hardware. Some operating systems share many similarities, the kernel is often one of these. For example, many distributions of Linux use the same kernel.</p>

<p>Anything excluding the kernel is likely either drivers (these help the OS interface with hardware), background programs or premilinary software - applications that the user would use. </p>
