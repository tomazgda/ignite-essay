        <h3>Literature Review</h3>

      <p>Any knowledge that I bear is simply a regurgitation of the knowledge of others - most often, the knowledge of those I admire. (I am far more susceptible to taking in information for someone I respect.) With a typical literature review one would select their primary sources and analyse each of them. However, my primary sources are people rather than websites or textbooks. Because of this, my literature review is formatted in a way that the individual sources are packaged under their respective people.</p>

      <p>For example, the first person included in this literature review is Richard Stallman. His section includes a brief regarding his character, comparable to the analysis of a source as well as a list of actual sources to some of his work. I find, in this context, this to be a more fitting solution than just monotonously listing sources with mundane explanations.</p>

      <p>Those who are part of this relatively short list are individuals who have contributed staggering amounts to the world of computing. Each of them began their quests by pursuing their passions despite social pressures. Being a computer 'nerd' during the childhoods of these characters wouldn't have been a breezy experience to say the least. Despite this, they were able to shape the world, occasionally without the recognition they truly deserve.</p>

      <h3>Richard Stallman</h3>

      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Richard_Stallman_at_LibrePlanet_2019.jpg/1024px-Richard_Stallman_at_LibrePlanet_2019.jpg" alt="Richard Stallman" style="float:right;width:50%;height:;">

      <h4>Character</h4>

      <p>Richard Stallman is a programmer - quite an astonishing one as well. But, beyond that, he is a political activist; he is a campaigner of human rights with regards to software - a field not typically considered when reflecting upon our liberties. He is the architect of the GNU project and a front runner in the free software movement. Stallman argues for a world without the proprietary software that lets corporation puppet us with malicious programs that strip control away from the user.</p>

      <p>The free software movement, and subsidiaries of, has been covered already but the crucial takeaway here is that Richard Stallman was behind it; those that continue to fight the companies we mindlessly sell our souls to are doing so because of him. Fame frequently corrupts those that acquire it but if anyone is impervious to any form of corruption, or even moral ambiguity, it's Richard Stallman.</p>

      <h4>Mediums</h4>

      <p>This section will follow more strictly along the lines of a literature review, focusing on specific sources rather. The first of which being the GNU website, primarily, in this instance, the GNU manifesto which can be found here:</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">GNU Manifesto</a></p>

      <p>Written in 1985, the GNU manifesto was rather similar to most other manifestos: it detailed what the main concept was, offered answers for common queries and sought help to further its development. For anyone unsure of what the GNU project is, it is a great source, though quite old, to seek answers about GNU.</p>

      <p><a href="https://stallman.org/">Stallman's Personal Site</a></p>

      There is no doubt that Stallman can appear quite eccentric at times. Even he would likely not suggest that everyone must live the life he does though it is definately benefitial to take a look at his perception of the world.

      <p><a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/20140407-geneva-tedx-talk-free-software-free-society">Ted Talk</a></p>

      Lectures (or talks) serve as a convenient medium for gathering information. Ted talks are some of the best if all you desire is a brief introduction to a topic and that holds true to Stallmans talk. Above is the link to the talk hosted on the Free Software Movement's website where the video complies with the principles of free software - you can download it. Downloading a video is an operation so mundane that it is often overlooked but it is common practice to block video downloading. YouTube, for example, prohibits its users from downloading videos unless they pay a premium and, even then, they can only view the downloaded content on YouTube.

      <h3>Linus Torvalds</h3>

      <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.facesofopensource.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F02%2F09202215%2Flinus.faces22052.web_.jpg&f=1&nofb=1" alt="Linus Torvalds" style="float:right;width:50%;height:;">

      <h4>Character</h4>

      <p>Linus Torvalds is most famously known for developing the Linux kernel as well as Git. The Linux kernel is present in most of the worlds computers. From desktops to smartphones to fridges, Linux is everywhere. It serves as the kernel for most GNU/Linux operating systems as well as the world's largest mobile OS: Android.</p>

      <p>Linus originally began writing the kernel as he was displeased by the costs associated with preexisting UNIX and MS-DOS systems. After completion of the kenral, those at the GNU project, who needed a kernel to complete their operating system, decided to use it and so GNU/Linux was born.</p>

      <h4>Mediums</h4>

      <p><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux">Ted Talk</a></p>

      <p>As with before, Ted talks are possibly one of the best ways to learn of certain topics.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux">Wikipedia: Linux kernel</a></p>

      <p>Unlike Stallman, Linus doesn't have a personal website. He also doesn't tend to write as many online articles as well. However, a key source to learn more about not only Linus, but also the Linux kernel itself is the Wikipedia article respective to either.
